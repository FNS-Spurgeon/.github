# Caroline Spurgeon: Chaucer Allusions, Shakespeare's Imagery, and the Digital Humanities

## Project
The digital part of the SNSF project "Caroline Spurgeon: Chaucer Allusions, Shakespeare's Imagery, and the Digital Humanities" aims to create the first open-access database dedicated to the criticism and reception of Chaucer throughout history. It draws on the compilation and cataloguing work carried out by Professor Caroline Spurgeon (1869–1942) and collected in *Five Hundred Years of Chaucer Criticism and Allusion*. This work consists of three volumes and a supplement, which will be systematically transcribed, corrected, enriched, encoded and published online, in order to facilitate future research and bring new perspectives to light. This repository contains all the data and materials used and produced to edit and analyse this corpus.
